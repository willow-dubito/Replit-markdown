# Markdown Template for Replit

This is a simple and easy to use markdown template for Replit! Edit the `index.md` file in the `markdown` folder to change the resulting website and edit `views/index.ejs` to modify the surrounding ejs template (title, css, etc). Changes are deployed automatically, so theres no need to stop and start the server, just reload the hosted webpage. 

If you want to make more than one page, simply make a new file in the `markdown` folder (make sure to have the `.md` file extension!). The resulting page will be hosted at `/<filename>`, so if I make a file named `piero.md`, it will pop up at `/piero`.
